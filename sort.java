//Time Complexity (TC): We traverse the entire array once with the `currentPointer`
//Space Complexity (SC):We use only a fixed number of extra variables (`zeroPointer`, `twoPointer`, `currentPointer`) regardless of input size
 
//Use three pointers: `zeroPointer` for placing 0s, `twoPointer` for placing 2s, and `currentPointer` to traverse the array.
//If the current element is 0, swap it with `zeroPointer` and move both pointers forward; if it's 2, swap it with `twoPointer` and move only `twoPointer` back.
//If it's 1, just move `currentPointer` forwardâ€”this ensures all 0s are on the left, 2s on the right, and 1s in the middle.
